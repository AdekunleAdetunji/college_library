# College Library Overview

## Problem Statement

During my undergraduate days, a significant challenge encountered in utilizing the school library was the lack of a system to determine the availability of a book before physically visiting the library. This resulted in wasted time searching for books that were either unavailable or already borrowed. Additionally, I observed the manual entry process undertaken by librarians, leading to potential errors.

## Motivation

Driven by the identified issues, the concept of the "College Library" web application emerged. Recognizing the potential for a solution through a web-based platform, the motivation behind this application is to streamline book management for librarians and provide students with the convenience of checking book availability and making reservations.

## About the App

The College Library application is designed specifically for educational institutions to efficiently manage their library resources. It aims to simplify book management for librarians while offering students the ability to check book availability and make reservations.

## How the App Works

The application features two distinct frontends, catering to librarians and users (staff and students).

### Librarian Frontend

Librarians will utilize this interface to monitor books, identify borrowed items, send reminders to borrowers, and manually input entries for newly acquired books.

### Liberary user Frontend

Users have access to this interface for scanning the library, checking book availability, making reservations, and obtaining information about the location of specific books.

## Technical Details

As discussed in the introduction, the application comprises two frontends and a single backend.

### Frontend

The user interfaces, accessible to both staffs and students, will be developed using Next.js, a variant of JavaScript. This development will be undertaken by Olawale Olawole.

### Backend

The backend of the application, responsible for supplying data to the frontend from the database, will be developed using FastAPI, a Python web development framework. This aspect of the project will be managed by Adekunle Adetunji.

### Database

The database will store comprehensive information about the library, including details about librarians, students, and book metadata (author name, year of publication, ISBN, etc.). PostgreSQL, a relational database, will be employed for this purpose, with Adekunle Adetunji overseeing its implementation.
